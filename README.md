In every corner of the world, people are facing lots of health complications and diseases and 
diabetic retinopathy disease is one of them. Deep learning is an effective means to assist an eye 
specialist to analyze the vast amount of retina images, which can potentially have a substantial role 
in streamlining and accelerating the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. These techniques require 
large datasets for training, and to use them, all the data must be centralized. Often, it is not possible 
to collect and share patient data on a centralized server due to medical data privacy regulations. 
Our work will present a collaborative federated learning framework capable of analyzing images 
using deep learning without sharing patient information between medical institutions. The dataset 
we are going to use consists of images and is classified into 5 classes as No Diabetic Retinopathy, 
Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). The data set consists of 
more than 35000 retinopathic images collected from Kaggle, a popular data repository. Following 
is the dataset link of Kaggle repository:

The effective outcome is to predict the test image that can be classified into class of diabetic 
retinopathy problem.
